## Exercise 1: Read Chapter 1 of Tufte (2001).

-   1) What is the most interesting lesson, guide, or piece of advice Tufte
    offers you in this chapter?

I really liked Tufte's final notes on p. 51. In particular he said "Graphical excellence is that which gives to the view the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space."

This clear and direct emphasis on minimalism reminded me that simplicity is key with data visualizations.

-   2) Tufte shares some of his favorite graphics in this chapter. Pick one
(but not the one about the military advance on and retreat from Russia)
and answer the following.

::: {}
![Life Cycle of the Japanese Beetle](images/GraphicScreenshot.png){style="border-radius: 10px;"}

*L. Hugh Newman, Man and Insects (London, 1965), pp. 104-105.*
:::

-   a. What page is your graphic on? \[Take a screen shot and include the image
as well, if you can.\]

Page 43

-   b. Why did you pick the graphic you chose?

I chose this graphic because I appreciated the artistic continuity when balanced with the simplicity of the message. It is very clear what the graphic represents, but as a visual learner myself, I found it very useful to understand and visualize.

-   c. What encoding channels are used in the graphic? What variables are they
associated with?

The marks are lines showing the months of the year, representing change over time, and are represented on the x-axis. TThe y-axis corresponds to gravity and elements above/below the earth within the image. This is done to highlight the life cycle of the beetle coming from and returning to the earth. There is minimal color involved (just shading with lights and darks within the image to highlight the beetle). In terms of fill, the whole graphic is filled with the image.

-   d. What, if any, elements of the graphic would be hard/impossible for you
to implement in Vega-Lite (given what we know so far)?

I would have no idea how to create such a complex image as a graph. My only thought would be to save the image itself as a background image and then layer the months and grid lines over top.

-   e. What point is Tufte illustrating with this graphic?

Tufte is illustrating the space-time-story graphic idea and highlighting the potential to mix the space and time aspects within the x-axis.

## Exercise 2: Read the following pages from (Knaflic 2020, chap. 2, pp 81-90;101-103).

-   List one or two ideas that you learned in these sections that will change the way you design and create data graphics.

I really appreciated how on pg. 88, after determining that the timeline on the x-axis was not consistent the author not only spent time to fix the graph, but interpreted a potential reason for the inconsistency and created a subplot accordingly. This was a reminder to me that there are always different (and potentially better!) ways to display data and emphasize the point that you are trying to make.

## Exercise 3: Do Exercise 2.13 (Knaflic 2020, p 96).

##### STEP 1: List three things that are not ideal about this graph. What makes it challenging?

1. There are two y-axes with separate variables.

2. The y-axis on the right does not start at 0.

3. There is both a line graph and a bar chart with overlapping labels, making it difficult to read.

##### STEP 2: For each of the three things you’ve listed, describe how you would overcome the given challenge.

In order to overcome the given challenge, I would do the following:

-   Rather than using a dual-axis graph, I would split them up into separate facets.

-   Another option would be to represent them with the same mark and layer them with the same scale.

-   Start the y-axis at 0.

-   Simplify the color scheme.

-   Reduce or eliminate the harsh grid lines.

-   Ensure the labels are easy to read or remove them entirely.


##### STEP 3: Download the data. Create your visual that puts into practice the strategies you’ve outlined.

The vertical concatenation of the graphs allows them both to be displayed accurately, with proper y-axes, while also maintaining easy comparability, highlighting changes over time (throwback to *Exercise #1*).
